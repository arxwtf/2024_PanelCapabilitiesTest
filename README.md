Simple PCB intended to test PCB fab house capabilities when it comes to using PCBs as front panels for electronic projects.

Testing:
- various colors (silkscreen, soldermask, uncovered copper with finish, bare PCB core)
- using large silkscreen areas as means of coloring
- copper pour hatchings with various settings for different panel surface feel
- inner cutouts and slots and with border radius of 0 and 0.8mm
- outer edge cutouts with right angles, border radius of 0 and 0.8mm
- large hole with diameter above the maximum drill size, which needs to be routed out by the fab house
